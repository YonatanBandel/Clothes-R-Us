        i. This 'readme' was made by Inbal Preuss<br><br>
        ii. The name of the store is "Clothes-R-Us" (which comes from "Toys-R-Us")<br><br>
        iii. We sell clothes<br><br>
        iv. A "Our Products" that shows 2 youtube videos embedded in the component that show our products in fashion shows <br> A
        "Delivery Policy" page that ensures our customers that we are reliable<br><br>
        v. Understanding how to setup cookies in the server and how to implement them in express<br />
        Also the testing part, I spend some time online to further understand how testing in the api world works.<br />
        In addition, I had to learn react and how to work with react router library and Redux.<br><br>
        vi. My insanly cool partner is Yonatan Bandel, id 203662572<br>
        (The following refers to question no.2 in the "Final Project (2019)" docs file)<br>
        Yonatan did: section b: i, ii (login screen), iii, iv, v, vi, vii<br>
        I did: section b: ii (remember me + cookies), viii, ix, section d<br><br>
        vii. The routes the app supports are:<br>
        '/admin', '/cart', '/delivery' '/checkout', '/login', '/logout' '/registration', '/products', <br>
        The only routes which are exposed to users before login are 'login' and 'registration' and 'readme's<br><br><br>
        viii. I used secured cookies which I setup on the server side using express cookie-parser library.
        I signed the cookie with the username, so the user will not be able to manipulate them.
        In addition, i made them HttpOnly so they can't be accessed from code, and they will be sent for every request
        to the server.<br><br>
        ix. Yes <br><br>
