<h1>Shipping and Delivery Policy</h1>
<strong>We want each order to reach you as quickly as possible</strong>
<p>So that you know what to expect, we provide some general guidelines here, though the timing of delivery of your order may be slightly different to that outlined below.</p>

<strong>If no one is home</strong>
<p>If no one is home at the time, usually the driver will contact you to confirm the alternative delivery address or will leave a note for you so the parcel can be pickup by you from the nearest Post Office. Please leave your best contact phone number so the driver can confirm delivery time if applicable.</p>
